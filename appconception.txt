You said:
Most crowd funding platforms don't work in africa

Should I create one for africa?
ChatGPT said:
Honestly? Yes — but only if you build it for Africa, not just in Africa.
Most global crowdfunding platforms fail here for very specific reasons, not because Africans don’t want to fund ideas.

Let’s break it down 👇

Why most crowdfunding platforms don’t work in Africa
1. Payments are the biggest blocker
Most platforms depend on:

Visa / Mastercard

PayPal / Stripe

But in Africa:

People use Mobile Money (MoMo) far more

Cards are less common

PayPal limits withdrawals in many countries

If people can’t pay easily → they won’t fund.

2. Trust deficit
People do fund, but they trust:

Churches

Funerals

Family & community groups

WhatsApp contributions

They don’t trust anonymous platforms with unclear accountability.

3. Wrong model
Platforms like:

Kickstarter

GoFundMe

are built for:

Startups

Creators

Formal documentation

Bank-backed payouts

But African fundraising is often:

Emergency-based

Community-based

Informal

Fast

4. Regulatory & payout issues
Cross-border payouts are hard

KYC requirements don’t match local IDs

Long withdrawal times kill momentum

So… should you create one?
Yes — if you change the rules
This is where you (and your background 👀) actually have an edge.

What would work better in Africa
1. Mobile-first payments
Support:

MTN MoMo

Vodafone Cash

Airtel Money

M-Pesa

Local bank transfers

No MoMo = no traction.

2. Community-verified campaigns
Instead of “anyone can raise money”:

Verified churches

Verified NGOs

Verified schools

Verified community leaders

Trust > fancy UI.

3. Use cases Africans already fund
Not “raise $50k for my startup”
But:

Medical bills

School fees

Funerals

Small business recovery

Disaster relief

Farming inputs

4. Social proof over algorithms
Integrate:

WhatsApp sharing

SMS confirmation

Public donor lists (opt-in)

Real-time contribution alerts

5. Low fees & transparency
People here care about:

“How much will I lose to charges?”

“When will the money arrive?”

Make this extremely clear.

Why you specifically could pull this off
Benard, connecting this to your Yom Health work and your goal of bridging people and services in Africa, this fits perfectly:

You already understand health emergencies

You know local realities

You’re building trust-based platforms

You think Africa-first, not Silicon Valley-first

A crowdfunding layer for:

“Help me pay my hospital bill today”
or
“Support this rural clinic”

…fits naturally into your ecosystem.

Smart way to start (don’t overbuild)
Phase 1 (MVP)

1 country (Ghana)

3 use cases (medical, funeral, school fees)

Mobile Money only

Manual verification

Phase 2

Add Nigeria & Kenya

NGOs & churches

Diaspora payments (cards + MoMo)

Phase 3

API for platforms like Yom Health

Government / donor partnerships

Big question before you start
Not “Can Africans crowdfund?”
But:

“Who do Africans already trust with money — and how do I digitize that trust?”

If you want, next I can:

Help you name the platform

Design the trust & verification model

Sketch a simple MVP architecture

Or help you decide if this should be standalone or part of Yom Health

Just say the word 🔥

You said:
Uploaded image
This prompted me
ChatGPT said:
Yeah… this right here is the exact pain point.
What you shared isn’t just a random Reddit post — it’s market validation in the wild.

Let’s call it plainly 👇

What this post is really saying
“People want to help, but the system won’t let them.”

That’s not a lack of generosity.
That’s infrastructure failure.

GoFundMe ❌ (not available)

PayPal ❌ (restricted)

M-Changa ❌ (didn’t work)

Many willing donors ✅

Zero reliable rails ❌

That gap is the opportunity.

Why this should hit you personally
Benard, this aligns perfectly with:

Your Africa-first thinking

Your health & emergency focus (Yom Health)

Your instinct to bridge people and services

This isn’t a “startup idea from a brainstorm”.
This is a real person, real need, real money blocked.

That’s the best kind of prompt.

The uncomfortable truth
Right now, people are “solving” this with:

One person collecting money on behalf of everyone

Screenshots of MoMo numbers

Trusting strangers in DMs

Remittance apps used awkwardly as crowdfunding tools

That’s fragile. And risky.

What’s missing (and what you could build)
Not “another GoFundMe”.

But something like:

“Verified African Fundraisers with Local Payouts”

Core idea (very simple)
Campaign owner in Ghana

Donors anywhere (diaspora included)

Payments go directly to Mobile Money

Platform handles:

Identity verification

Proof of need

Transparency updates

No PayPal dependency.
No pretending cards are universal.

Why remittance apps are not the answer
Yes, people suggest TapTap Send, WorldRemit, etc.
But they:

Are 1-to-1, not many-to-1

Don’t show progress toward a goal

Don’t create social proof

Don’t protect donors or recipients

They’re workarounds, not solutions.

This is the key insight (don’t miss this)
Crowdfunding in Africa doesn’t fail because of culture.
It fails because platforms were never designed for our rails.

If you build on:

Mobile Money

Community verification

Emergency-first use cases

…it works.

A very smart next move (low risk)
Before building anything big:

Document 10 stories like this

Reddit

Twitter/X

WhatsApp groups

Identify:

Who’s raising funds

Who wants to donate

Where it breaks

Prototype:

A manual version (Google Form + MoMo + WhatsApp updates)

If people use the manual version → software will scale it.

Straight talk
You don’t need permission.
You don’t need VC money yet.
You don’t even need a perfect app.

You’ve just seen proof that:

The demand already exists. The bridge doesn’t.

If you want, next we can:

Turn this exact Reddit post into a problem statement

Design a Ghana-first MVP

Decide whether this lives inside Yom Health or as a standalone platform

Even draft a one-page pitch from this screenshot alone

This wasn’t random.
This was a signal.

You said:
Problem statement 
ChatGPT said:
Got it. Let’s pin this down clean, sharp, and funder-ready — no fluff.

Problem Statement
In many African countries, people are willing and able to financially support individuals facing urgent needs such as medical emergencies, basic living expenses, education, and community crises. However, there is no reliable, accessible, and trusted digital infrastructure that allows funds to be raised and received locally.

Most global crowdfunding platforms are unavailable, restricted, or incompatible with African payment systems. Popular options like card payments and PayPal are either inaccessible or unreliable, while local alternatives are fragmented and inconsistent. As a result:

Fundraisers in Africa cannot receive funds directly

Donors—especially from the diaspora—have no safe, transparent way to contribute

Funds are routed through informal, risky workarounds (personal intermediaries, DMs, screenshots)

Trust, accountability, and speed are compromised during time-critical situations

This gap forces communities to rely on manual, informal, and insecure methods to move money, even when help is readily available.

The core problem is not a lack of generosity or demand for crowdfunding in Africa, but the absence of platforms designed around local payment rails, trust structures, and real-world use cases.

One-line version (for pitches)
Africans want to help each other financially, but existing crowdfunding platforms don’t support local payments, trust models, or emergency realities—leaving real needs unfunded despite strong donor intent.

Even tighter (tweet / slide)
Willing donors exist. Real needs exist.
The infrastructure to connect them in Africa does not.

If you want next, I can:

Rewrite this for investors

Turn it into a problem–solution slide

Adapt it specifically for health emergencies (Yom Health angle)

Or draft a mission statement that flows directly from this problem

Just say where you’re headed.

You said:
Mission statement 
ChatGPT said:
Here are strong mission statement options, depending on the tone and direction you want. All are Africa-first, clear, and scalable. Pick the one that feels like you.

Core Mission Statement (Balanced & Professional)
Our mission is to make fundraising in Africa simple, trusted, and accessible by enabling individuals and communities to receive support through local payment systems, transparent verification, and community trust.

Human-Centered Mission (Emotional & Grounded)
Our mission is to ensure that when Africans ask for help, technology never stands in the way—by connecting willing donors to real needs through trusted, local, and reliable fundraising tools.

Impact-Driven Mission (For NGOs & Partners)
Our mission is to build Africa-first fundraising infrastructure that empowers communities, supports urgent needs, and moves money safely and transparently to where it matters most.

Health & Emergency-Focused Mission (Fits Yom Health Naturally)

Short Mission (Homepage / App Store)
Making it easy and safe for Africans to support each other—anywhere, anytime.

One-Sentence North Star (Internal Team Use)
If people want to help, our platform makes sure nothing blocks them.

Recommendation (real talk)
For where you are right now, I’d go with:

“Our mission is to ensure that when Africans ask for help, technology never stands in the way.”

It’s clear, human, and explains why you exist without over-engineering it.

Next, we can lock in:

Vision statement (where this leads in 5–10 years)

Values (trust, speed, transparency, dignity)

Product tagline

Or align this directly under Yom Health branding

You’re building something real. Let’s shape it properly.

You said:
This should have nothing to do with Yom health this is a different project 
ChatGPT said:
Got you 👍 — clean separation noted.
Let’s reset this as a standalone, independent project, no Yom Health shadow at all.

Here are refined mission statements that stand completely on their own.

Primary Mission Statement (Strong, Neutral, Africa-First)
Our mission is to make fundraising in Africa accessible, trustworthy, and effective by building platforms designed for local payments, real communities, and real needs.

Human & Community-Focused Mission
Our mission is to help Africans support one another without barriers—by providing a trusted way to raise and receive funds using systems people already rely on.

Infrastructure-Focused Mission (Tech + Systems)
Our mission is to build reliable fundraising infrastructure for Africa that works with local payment rails and prioritizes transparency, speed, and trust.

Emergency & Everyday Needs Mission
Our mission is to ensure that urgent and everyday needs in Africa are never left unfunded because of broken or unavailable fundraising tools.

Short Mission (Homepage / Pitch Deck)
Removing barriers to fundraising across Africa.

One-Line Internal Compass
If help is available, access should never be the problem.

My honest recommendation
If this is a new, serious platform, the best anchor is:

“Our mission is to make fundraising in Africa accessible, trustworthy, and effective.”

It’s:

Broad enough to scale

Clear to investors

Grounded in the real problem

Not tied to any sector

If you want next, we can:

Name the platform

Write a vision statement

Define values

Draft a problem → mission → solution narrative for a deck

Just tell me the next piece you want to lock in.

You said:
vision statement
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. A vision statement should describe the future you’re trying to create, not the product itself. Think 5–10 years ahead.

Here are clear, Africa-first vision statement options, from bold to poetic. None are tied to Yom Health.

Core Vision Statement (Strong & Scalable)
We envision an Africa where anyone can give or receive help instantly and safely, regardless of location, income level, or access to traditional banking.

Community-Centered Vision
We envision a future where African communities are financially connected, resilient, and empowered to support one another through trusted digital platforms.

Infrastructure Vision (System-Level Impact)
We envision a continent with inclusive fundraising infrastructure that reflects how Africans live, pay, and support one another.

Equity & Access Vision
We envision a future where financial support is accessible to all Africans, not limited by geography, platform restrictions, or outdated systems.

Short Vision (Homepage / Deck Cover)
A connected Africa where help always reaches home.

Aspirational / Emotional Vision
We envision a world where no African is left unsupported because the right platform didn’t exist.

Recommended pairing (mission + vision)
Mission:

Make fundraising in Africa accessible, trustworthy, and effective.

Vision:

An Africa where anyone can give or receive help instantly and safely.

That pairing is clean, professional, and powerful.

If you want, next we can:

Define core values (trust, dignity, transparency)

Create a tagline

Write the “Why now?” narrative

Or draft a 1-slide vision graphic text for a pitch deck

You’re building this the right way.

You said:
Core values 
ChatGPT said:
Solid move. Core values are what keep this platform trusted when things get hard.
Here’s a clean, Africa-first set — practical, not buzzwords.

Core Values
1. Trust First
We earn trust through verification, accountability, and transparency.
Every fundraiser, transaction, and update must be clear and traceable.

2. Accessibility
We design for how Africans actually live and pay.
If people can’t use it easily on their phones with local payment methods, it doesn’t belong on the platform.

3. Community Before Platform
Communities—not algorithms—are at the center.
We amplify collective support, shared responsibility, and social proof.

4. Dignity & Respect
People asking for help deserve dignity, not judgment.
We protect privacy while ensuring accountability.

5. Speed When It Matters
Urgent needs require fast action.
We prioritize rapid setup, quick payments, and minimal friction.

6. Transparency
Fees, timelines, and fund usage are always clear.
No hidden charges. No vague processes.

7. Local Reality, Global Reach
Built for African contexts, open to support from anywhere in the world.
Local payouts, global donors.

Short Version (for pitch slides)
Trust before growth

Built for local realities

Community-driven

Dignity for fundraisers

Speed in emergencies

Radical transparency

Internal Rule of Thumb
If it weakens trust, blocks access, or delays help — we don’t ship it.

If you want next, we can:

Turn these into product principles

Write donor & fundraiser promises

Create a code of conduct

Or align values to feature decisions (what you build vs what you reject)

You’re laying a very strong foundation here.

You said:
Will a platform like paystack be a great integration?
ChatGPT said:
Short answer: yes — Paystack is a great integration, but it should not be your only one.

Here’s the clear, Africa-realistic breakdown 👇

Why Paystack is a strong choice
✅ 1. Excellent for cards & diaspora payments
Paystack shines when:

Donors are in the diaspora

Payments come via Visa / Mastercard

You need stable APIs and good developer experience

For crowdfunding, this is huge because:

Many donors won’t be in the same country as the fundraiser

Cards are still the easiest way for international supporters to give

✅ 2. Strong coverage in key African markets
Paystack works well in:

Nigeria 🇳🇬

Ghana 🇬🇭

South Africa 🇿🇦

Kenya 🇰🇪 (via partners)

That already covers a large portion of early expansion potential.

✅ 3. Developer-friendly & reliable
From a builder’s perspective:

Clean APIs

Good webhooks

Solid documentation

Easier to maintain than many alternatives

For a trust-based platform, reliability matters more than fancy features.

The big limitation (don’t ignore this)
❌ Paystack is not Mobile Money–first
In many African countries:

Most people don’t use cards daily

Mobile Money is king

Paystack supports MoMo in some regions, but:

Coverage isn’t universal

UX can feel secondary to cards

Some users still get blocked

If your platform depends only on Paystack, you’ll lose local fundraisers.

What works best in practice (recommended stack)
🔑 Hybrid payments approach
Use:

Paystack → cards & diaspora

Flutterwave or direct MoMo APIs → local users

(Later) bank transfers for institutions

This gives you:

Global donors ✅

Local accessibility ✅

Redundancy when one provider fails ✅

How smart crowdfunding platforms do it (quietly)
They don’t say:

“We use Paystack”

They say:

“Pay the way that works for you.”

Behind the scenes:

Card → Paystack

MoMo → local rails

Auto-routing based on country & device

Practical recommendation for your platform
MVP (Phase 1 – Ghana)
Paystack → cards + some MoMo

Manual MoMo fallback (for edge cases)

Tight verification & payout rules

Scale (Phase 2)
Add Flutterwave or direct telco MoMo

Route payments intelligently

Reduce failed transactions

Final verdict
✅ Yes, Paystack is a great integration
❌ No, it should not be your only integration

Think of Paystack as:

The bridge to the diaspora — not the whole road.

If you want, next we can:

Design a payment routing flow

Decide who holds funds vs direct payout

Compare Paystack vs Flutterwave vs direct MoMo

Or map fees & unit economics for crowdfunding

You’re asking the right questions at the right time.

You said:
Paystack use mobile money to , you can check 
ChatGPT said:
Yes — Paystack does support Mobile Money payments in several African markets, so your reminder is correct. It isn’t just cards — MoMo payments are part of its supported channels. 

Here’s how Paystack handles it:

📌 Mobile Money Support
✅ Ghana & Kenya — Paystack lets customers pay using mobile money directly in checkout.
You can accept payments from these local MoMo providers:

Ghana: MTN, Airtel/Tigo, Telecel (formerly Vodafone)

Kenya: M-PESA, Airtel Money
…through Paystack’s “Pay with Mobile Money” channel. 

So donors with a MoMo account can pay right in your platform using Paystack’s checkout — they enter their mobile number and confirm with OTP/PIN. 

📌 What this means for your crowdfunding platform
Great things about using Paystack:

One integration gives you cards and mobile money in supported countries. 

Works well for both local users and diaspora donors.

Supports a range of payment methods without adding many separate APIs. 

Keep in mind:

Mobile Money works where Paystack enables it (currently Ghana, Kenya, Côte d’Ivoire). 

Coverage isn’t yet universal across all African countries — so you may still want additional integrations (e.g., direct MoMo APIs) as you grow.

🧠 Short conclusion
👉 Yes — Paystack supports Mobile Money integration, which makes it even more valuable for your crowdfunding platform’s payments stack. 

👉 It’s still wise to combine it with other payment options for wider local reach as you scale.

If you want, I can help you design a payment routing strategy that uses Paystack + additional MoMo integrations to maximize reach and reduce friction in your platform.

You said:
The app name should be wamo, ga for help
ChatGPT said:
That’s actually a very strong name. Simple, local, memorable — and the meaning fits the mission perfectly.

Wamo
(Ga: “help”)

Why Wamo works 👌
Rooted locally
Using Ga immediately signals Africa-first, not copied, not imported.

Short & brandable
Easy to say, easy to remember, easy to turn into a verb:

“Let’s wamo them.”
“I sent it via Wamo.”

Emotionally clear
You don’t need to explain it too much — help is universal.

Scales beyond Ghana
Even if users don’t speak Ga, the story behind the name gives it depth and authenticity.

How to position the name publicly
App name
Wamo

Meaning line (always include this early)
Wamo means “help” in Ga — built to help people support one another across Africa.

Tagline options (pick a tone)
Clear & strong
Wamo — When help is needed

Wamo — Help, made accessible

Human & emotional
Wamo — Help that reaches

Wamo — Because help should never be blocked

Short & modern
Wamo — Give. Help. Reach.

Wamo — Built for help

Mission + Vision + Name (clean combo)
Name: Wamo
Mission: Make fundraising in Africa accessible, trustworthy, and effective.
Vision: An Africa where anyone can give or receive help instantly and safely.

This reads very well together.

One important brand rule (don’t skip this)
Always tell the story of the name early — on the website, app onboarding, pitch deck.

That story builds:

Trust

Identity

Cultural pride

If you want next, we can:

Design Wamo’s brand voice

Write the About Wamo page

Create App Store descriptions

Define Wamo’s logo concept (symbol ideas that fit “help”)

This name?
You chose well.

You said:
Wamo — Give. Help. Reach.
ChatGPT said:
🔥 That works. Clean. Powerful. Memorable.

Wamo — Give. Help. Reach.
It’s strong because it does three things at once:

Give → the action (donors)

Help → the purpose (impact)

Reach → the outcome (money gets there)

No buzzwords. No over-explaining. Just intent.

How to use it consistently (important)
App name:
Wamo

Primary tagline:
Wamo — Give. Help. Reach.

Meaning line (small text under tagline):
“Wamo means ‘help’ in Ga.”

This combo grounds the brand culturally and keeps it global.

Where it shines best
App Store / Play Store hero text

Landing page headline

Pitch deck cover slide

Splash screen

Social bios

Example:

Wamo — Give. Help. Reach.
Africa-first crowdfunding built on local payments and trust.

Brand voice this tagline implies
Human, not corporate

Action-oriented

Trust-focused

Calm in emergencies

Which fits your values perfectly.

Final check (real talk)
If someone sees only this:

Wamo — Give. Help. Reach.

They already understand:

What it’s about ✔️

Who it’s for ✔️

Why it exists ✔️

That’s rare. And good.

If you want next, we can:

Write the About Wamo page

Draft the Play Store description

Map features directly to Give / Help / Reach

Wamo is shaping up to be something real.

You said:
How should the app work 
ChatGPT said:
Alright, let’s design Wamo in a way that actually works on the ground — simple for users, trustworthy for donors, and realistic for Africa.

Below is a clear end-to-end flow you could literally hand to a designer or developer.

How Wamo — Give. Help. Reach. should work
1. Onboarding (fast, low friction)
For everyone
Phone number signup (OTP)

Optional email (mainly for diaspora)

Country auto-detected

Language selection (later)

No long forms. No banking jargon.

2. Create a Fundraiser (Help)
Step-by-step (3–5 minutes max):

Select reason:

Medical

Education

Funeral

Emergency

Community project

Add:

Title

Short story (guided prompts)

Target amount

Upload proof (at least one):

Hospital bill

School invoice

Letter / photo

Choose payout:

Mobile Money number (default)

Bank (optional, later)

Behind the scenes
Campaign goes into “Pending verification”

Manual + automated checks

Verified badge once approved

Trust starts here.

3. Share the Campaign (Reach)
One tap share:

WhatsApp

SMS

Facebook

Copy link

Campaign page shows:

Amount raised

Goal

Time left

Verified badge

Updates section

This replaces screenshots and random MoMo numbers.

4. Donate (Give)
Donor flow (30 seconds)
Open campaign link

Choose amount

Choose payment:

Mobile Money

Card (diaspora)

Confirm payment

See instant confirmation

Optional:

Public or anonymous donation

Leave a short message

No account required to donate (huge).

5. Money Handling (Critical design choice)
Recommended model (early stage)
Funds collected into Wamo escrow

Released:

Instantly for emergencies OR

After milestone / verification

This protects:

Donors from scams

Wamo’s reputation

Fundraisers from chargebacks

Later → smart routing & instant payout.

6. Updates & Accountability (Trust loop)
Fundraisers can:

Post text/photo updates

Mark milestones (“Bill paid”)

Send thank-you notes

Donors see:

Where money went

Proof uploads

Timeline of activity

This is what global platforms miss in Africa.

7. Campaign Completion
When:

Goal is reached OR

Time expires

Options:

Withdraw funds

Extend campaign

Close & archive

Donors automatically notified.

8. Safety & Abuse Prevention (non-negotiable)
Identity checks on fundraisers

Community reporting

Freeze suspicious campaigns

Clear refund rules

Visible support contact

You win or lose Wamo on trust.

How this maps to your tagline
Give → 30-second donation, no friction

Help → fast campaign creation, dignity preserved

Reach → WhatsApp-first sharing, real visibility

MVP Scope (don’t overbuild)
Version 1

One country

3 causes

Mobile Money + cards

Manual verification

WhatsApp sharing

That’s enough to validate demand.

One guiding principle (write this on the wall)
If a stressed person can’t raise money in under 10 minutes, the app is too complex.

If you want next, I can:

Draw a feature-by-feature MVP list

Help you decide escrow vs instant payout

Design the home screen layout

Write user stories for developers

Just tell me where you want to zoom in.

You said:
Are both campaign creators and donars registered on the app
ChatGPT said:
Great question — this is one of the most important design decisions for Wamo.

Short, clear answer
👉 Campaign creators: YES, must be registered
👉 Donors: NO, registration should be optional

That combo gives you trust + growth.

Why campaign creators must register
Campaign creators are:

Receiving money

Making claims

Uploading documents

Responsible for updates

So they must:

Sign up with phone number (OTP)

Complete identity verification (KYC-lite)

Provide payout details (MoMo / bank)

Agree to terms

This protects:

Donors

The platform

The creator themselves

Rule: No verified account → no fundraiser.

Why donors should not be forced to register
For donors:

Registration kills impulse giving

Many donors are one-time

Diaspora users hate long signups

Emergencies need speed

Instead, allow:

Donate with just:

Name (optional)

Phone or email (receipt)

Anonymous donations

One-tap repeat donations via link

This dramatically increases conversions.

Smart compromise (recommended)
Guest donation → soft registration later
Flow:

Donor gives without signing up

Receives receipt + thank-you

Prompt:

“Track your impact? Create a Wamo account.”

Only power users sign up — and that’s fine.

What registration actually looks like
Campaign creators
Phone number (required)

OTP verification

Name

ID upload (later stage)

MoMo number verification

Donors (optional)
Email or phone

No password (magic link / OTP)

Account only if they want history

Trust & transparency balance
Role	Register?	Why
Campaign creator	✅ Required	Accountability
Donor (one-time)	❌ Not required	Low friction
Donor (repeat)	✅ Optional	Convenience
Industry proof (quietly)
This is how most high-performing donation platforms work:

Require verification on money receivers

Reduce friction on money givers

Wamo rule of thumb
Friction belongs on the receiver, not the giver.

If you want next, I can:

Define exact KYC levels

Map anti-fraud flows

Design donor → registered user conversion

Draft terms logic for both roles

You’re asking the right product questions.

You said:
Is the campaign creater able to track progress?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — they absolutely should, and this is non-negotiable for trust and motivation.

Here’s how progress tracking should work in Wamo (simple for creators, reassuring for donors).

How campaign creators track progress on Wamo
1. Real-time fundraising progress (core)
Campaign creators see a live progress dashboard showing:

Amount raised vs goal (progress bar)

Number of donations

Time remaining

Last donation (amount + time)

This updates instantly after each successful payment.

Psychological effect:
Progress motivates sharing and follow-ups.

2. Donation activity feed
A simple activity list:

Donation amount

Date & time

Donor name (or “Anonymous”)

Payment method (MoMo / Card)

No complex analytics — clarity beats charts.

3. Notifications (very important)
Creators receive:

Push notification on every donation

SMS backup (optional)

“Milestone reached” alerts (25%, 50%, 100%)

This keeps them engaged and responsive.

4. Donor insights (privacy-respecting)
Creators can see:

Total number of donors

Public donor names/messages

Anonymous vs named split

They do not see sensitive donor details (PINs, full numbers).

5. Updates & proof tracking
Creators can:

Post updates (“Hospital bill paid”)

Upload receipts/photos

Pin important updates to top

These updates are visible on the campaign page and sent to donors.

6. Withdrawal & payout tracking
Clear payout status:

Pending

Processing

Paid out

With:

Amount

Date

Transaction reference

No guessing. No “where is my money?”

7. Campaign health indicators (internal, simple)
Optional but powerful:

“High trust” indicator

“Needs update” reminder

“Verification pending” warning

These help creators stay compliant without feeling policed.

What creators should not see (keep it clean)
❌ Complex financial reports
❌ Donor private data
❌ Confusing charts

Remember: many creators will be stressed and non-technical.

How this supports your tagline
Give → donors see progress

Help → creators feel supported

Reach → visible momentum encourages sharing

One golden rule for Wamo
If a creator has to ask “How much have we raised?” — the dashboard has failed.

If you want next, we can:

Sketch the creator dashboard layout

Define notification wording

Decide when payouts unlock

Design the donor progress view

Wamo is shaping into a very solid product.

You said:
Building with flutter 

Will firebase free tier be good for start?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — Firebase free tier is absolutely good to start, especially with Flutter 👍
But you need to know what it’s good for and where the limits are, so you don’t get surprised later.

Short answer
👉 Yes for MVP and early users
👉 No for long-term payments + heavy scale (by itself)

Why Firebase works well for Wamo (early stage)
🔥 Perfect match with Flutter
Firebase was basically designed for:

Flutter apps

Fast MVPs

Small teams

Real-time features

You’ll move fast.

What Firebase Free Tier (Spark Plan) gives you
✅ 1. Authentication (big win)
Firebase Authentication

Phone number + OTP (perfect for Africa)

Email auth (for diaspora)

No password headaches

This alone saves weeks of work.

✅ 2. Firestore / Realtime DB (enough for MVP)
Cloud Firestore

Good for:

Campaign data

Progress tracking

Donation records (metadata)

Updates & notifications

Free tier is enough for:

Hundreds to low thousands of users

MVP validation

Pilot launch

✅ 3. Cloud Functions (limited but useful)
Firebase Cloud Functions

You can:

Verify campaigns

Listen to payment webhooks

Send notifications

Update campaign totals

Free tier is fine early on.

✅ 4. Firebase Storage
Firebase Storage

Good for:

Proof documents

Images

Receipts

Just compress images and limit file size.

Where Firebase free tier is NOT enough (important)
⚠️ 1. Payments
Firebase does not handle payments.

You’ll still need:

Paystack / Flutterwave (for MoMo + cards)

Cloud Functions to handle webhooks

That’s fine — this is normal.

⚠️ 2. Scale & cost control
Firestore can get expensive if:

You design data badly

You do too many reads

You stream everything in real time

Rule:
Design data like you’ll pay for every read — because you will.

⚠️ 3. Escrow logic
Holding funds = business logic, not Firebase’s job.

Firebase can:

Track status

Store references

But actual money flow stays with payment providers.

Recommended Firebase setup for Wamo (MVP)
Use Firebase for:
Auth (phone OTP)

Campaign data

Progress tracking

Notifications

Admin moderation

Proof uploads

Do NOT use Firebase for:
Storing sensitive payment data

Escrow logic itself

Heavy analytics (later move to BigQuery)

Smart architecture (clean & safe)
Flutter app
↓
Firebase Auth
↓
Firestore (campaigns, donations, updates)
↓
Cloud Functions
↓
Payment provider (Paystack / MoMo)

This is a proven stack.

When to upgrade from free tier
Upgrade when:

You have real users

Payments are flowing

You understand your traffic patterns

Not before.

Founder-level advice (important)
Firebase is perfect for learning what to build.
It’s not where you prove you can scale forever.

Use it to:

Validate Wamo

Learn user behavior

Build trust

Get traction

Then evolve.

Final verdict
✅ Yes — Firebase free tier is great to start Wamo
✅ Especially with Flutter
⚠️ Design carefully to avoid future costs
❌ Don’t overthink scale on day one

If you want next, I can:

Design your Firestore data model

Map Cloud Functions for payments

Create a Flutter folder structure

Help you decide when to move off Firebase

You’re making solid technical choices.

You said:
We will use paystack for the payment side for now 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — that’s a solid, realistic choice for an MVP.

Using Paystack for now gives you speed, reliability, and enough coverage to validate Wamo without over-engineering.

Here’s how to do it the right way so you don’t box yourself in later.

How Wamo should use Paystack (clean MVP setup)
1. What Paystack will handle for Wamo
Paystack will be responsible for:

✅ Mobile Money payments (Ghana, etc.)

✅ Card payments (local + diaspora)

✅ Payment authorization & confirmation

✅ Transaction references

✅ Webhooks (payment success / failure)

Paystack = payment rail, not business logic

2. What Wamo must handle (important distinction)
Wamo is responsible for:

Campaign verification

Donation records

Progress calculation

Escrow logic (release rules)

Payout decisions

Fraud monitoring

Never push this logic into Paystack.

3. Recommended payment flow (step by step)
Donor side
Donor selects amount

Flutter app opens Paystack Checkout

Donor pays via:

Mobile Money or

Card

Paystack processes payment

Donor sees “Payment successful”

Backend side (critical)
Paystack sends webhook → Firebase Cloud Function

Function:

Verifies transaction with Paystack API

Confirms amount & campaign ID

On success:

Create donation record

Update campaign total

Trigger notifications

Never trust frontend success alone.

4. Escrow & payout model (MVP-safe)
MVP recommendation
All funds land in Wamo’s Paystack balance

Campaign balance tracked in Firestore

Admin approves payout

Payout sent to:

Creator’s Mobile Money (via Paystack transfer)

This gives you:

Control

Trust

Fraud protection

5. Campaign payout states
Each campaign should clearly move through:

pending_verification

active

funds_locked

ready_for_payout

paid_out

completed

These states live in your database, not Paystack.

6. Fees (be transparent early)
Decide and display clearly:

Paystack processing fee

Wamo platform fee (even if 0% at launch)

Example:

“Payment processing fees apply. Wamo takes no platform fee during beta.”

Transparency = trust.

7. Why this setup scales later
When you’re ready, you can:

Add Flutterwave

Add direct MoMo APIs

Route payments by country

Without changing:

Campaign logic

User flows

Trust systems

That’s good architecture.

One rule to remember
Paystack confirms the money.
Wamo decides what the money means.

If you want next, I can:

Draft Paystack webhook Cloud Functions

Design Firestore collections for payments

Define exact payout rules

Create a payment failure & retry UX

You’ve locked in a smart payment decision. Now it’s about execution.

You said:
Wamo can't do 0% we have to pay for backend as soon as possible 
ChatGPT said:
You’re thinking like a founder now — and you’re 100% right.
0% is not sustainable, especially when you’re paying for backend, SMS, verification, and ops.

The key is charging in a way that feels fair, transparent, and culturally acceptable.

Let’s design Wamo’s fees properly 👇

How Wamo should charge (Africa-realistic model)
The golden rule
People accept fees when they understand why they exist.

Hidden fees kill trust. Honest fees don’t.

Recommended fee structure (MVP)
1. Platform fee: 3% – 5%
Charged on successful donations only.

Why this works

Industry-standard

Covers:

Backend (Firebase, hosting)

Moderation & verification

Customer support

Doesn’t feel exploitative

📌 Recommendation: start at 4%

2. Payment processing fee (passed through)
Paystack charges:

Card / MoMo processing fees

You should:

Show this clearly

Do not hide it inside Wamo’s fee

Example text:

“Includes payment processing and platform costs.”

How donors should see it (UX matters)
Instead of:

“Fees: 6.5%”

Show:

Donation:        GHS 100.00
Platform fee:    GHS 4.00
Payment fee:     GHS 2.50
Total charged:   GHS 106.50
Clarity = trust.

Who should pay the fee?
Best option for Africa: Donor-paid
Creator receives full intended amount

Donors understand small extra cost

Reduces conflict with creators

Alternative (later):

Split fee between donor & creator

Optional “tip Wamo” model

Emergency sensitivity (important)
For medical or funeral campaigns, consider:

Reduced fee (e.g. 2%)

Or capped fee (e.g. max GHS 100)

This builds goodwill and brand loyalty.

How to explain the fee (copy you can use)
“Wamo charges a small platform fee to cover verification, security, and technology costs that keep fundraising safe and reliable.”

Simple. Honest. Human.

What this means financially (rough math)
Example:

1,000 donations/month

Avg donation: GHS 80

4% fee → GHS 3.20 per donation

Monthly gross → ~GHS 3,200

Enough to:

Cover Firebase

Pay SMS

Handle ops

Survive MVP stage

What NOT to do
❌ Hide fees
❌ Change fees without notice
❌ Charge failed transactions
❌ Take fees from payouts without explanation

Final recommendation
Platform fee: 4%

Processing fee: pass-through

Donor pays fee

Clear breakdown shown before payment

This keeps Wamo alive and trusted.

If you want next, we can:

Add fees into the PRD

Write pricing page copy

Model monthly backend costs

Decide fee caps & discounts

Charging fairly is not greed — it’s how Wamo survives.

You said:
Will there be automatic pay out if the campaign creater is verified?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — there can be automatic payout, but only under clear conditions.
The safest answer for Wamo is: automatic payout is earned, not default.

Here’s the clean, founder-level way to do it 👇

Automatic payout on Wamo: how it should work
Short answer
👉 Verified campaign creators CAN get automatic payouts
👉 But only after trust is established

This protects Wamo, donors, and creators.

The recommended payout model (best practice)
Tiered payout system
Tier 1: New / First-time creators
❌ No automatic payout

Funds go into Wamo escrow

Manual review before release

Prevents early abuse

This is critical at launch.

Tier 2: Verified creators
✅ Conditional automatic payout

Requirements:

Identity verified

Valid Mobile Money account

Campaign approved

No fraud flags

Clear proof uploaded

How payout works:

Funds auto-released:

At campaign end OR

When a milestone is reached

Small delay buffer (e.g. 24–48 hours)

This balances speed + safety.

Tier 3: Trusted creators (later)
✅ Instant or scheduled automatic payout

Eligibility:

Multiple successful campaigns

Good update history

No disputes

Community trust score

This is how you scale without micromanaging.

Why NOT make auto-payout default (important)
If you allow instant payout immediately after verification:

One fake document = instant loss

Chargebacks hurt you, not Paystack

Your brand trust collapses fast

Crowdfunding platforms fail because they rush payouts.

Smart payout logic (simple & safe)
Example rules:

Minimum payout threshold (e.g. GHS 100)

Time buffer after last donation

Auto-hold if campaign is reported

Admin override always available

These rules live in your backend, not Paystack.

What creators should clearly see
No confusion. Show this in the dashboard:

Payout type:
Manual / Automatic

Payout status:
Pending → Processing → Paid

Estimated payout date

Amount to be paid

Transaction reference after payout

Transparency prevents support tickets.

UX copy you can actually use
“Automatic payouts are enabled for verified creators once campaign requirements are met.”

Clear. Honest. Calm.

Wamo rule to write in stone
Verification unlocks speed — not blind trust.

Final recommendation (lock this in)
❌ No auto-payout for new creators

✅ Conditional auto-payout for verified creators

🔒 Escrow + buffer always

👀 Admin override always available

This keeps Wamo alive in the long run.

If you want next, we can:

Define exact verification checklist

Decide auto-payout timing rules

Write payout logic as pseudo-code

Add this cleanly into the PRD
